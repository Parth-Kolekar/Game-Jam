## 📝 Overview:
This project is part of our first-year engineering course in Project-Based Learning (PBL), which is a part of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) 2019 Pattern. Our team has collaborated to create a platformer game using Pygame in Python.

## 📖 Description:
Our project, "Game Jam," is an exciting platformer game developed using the Pygame library in Python. Dive into an immersive adventure as you take on the role of a brave Viking warrior traversing through five thrilling levels of challenging obstacles and enemies.

Set against the backdrop of majestic mountains, each level features intricately designed platforms suspended in mid-air, creating a visually stunning environment for players to explore. As the Viking character, you must navigate through treacherous terrain, leap across gaps, and defeat enemies by jumping on their heads, Mario-style.

The gameplay is simple yet engaging - reach the red flag at the end of each level to unlock the next stage of your journey. With each level presenting new challenges and obstacles, players will need to master the art of timing, precision jumping, and enemy evasion to emerge victorious.
